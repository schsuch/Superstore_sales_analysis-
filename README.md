# Superstore_sales_analysis-
Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn and Plotly to expore sales of a variety of products at a superstore. 

This repository contains a dataset named "Superstorenew.csv" that provides information about products sold from 2014 to 2017 in a superstore located in the US. Additionally, we have used a "geo_location.csv" dataset to obtain the latitude and longitude of each city.

## Essential Steps of an EDA
The 3 essential steps of an Exploratory Data Analysis using the Pandas library:

## 1. Data Exploration
Exploring the variables in Excel to get a good understanding of the dataset. Next, importing the dataset using the Python Pandas library and use various key exploration commands to gain insights into the data.

## 2. Data Cleaning
If necessary, remove any rows that have missing values to ensure the dataset is complete and ready for analysis. 

## 3. Data Analysis
In this step, answer some specific questions related to the dataset using appropriate graphs and visualisations to provide meaningful insights. Using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
